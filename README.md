# ChessLogger
The trained model used for experimentation is given in the model folder as 
best_yolo.pt. This model is a YOLOv3 model and is compatible with the code found
at the github https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3.

The code for the ChessLogger system is given in the Jupyter Notebook ChessLogger.ipynb in the
Notebook folder. The notebook performs the methods stated in the paper and requires
an input image as well as a text file giving the labels and bounding boxes of pieces
in the image (output from yolo).
